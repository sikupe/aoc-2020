# Solutions for the Advent of Code 2020
This repository contains code to solve the puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

The code is written in Rust. It's most likely not very idiomatic, I'm just learning Rust.

## Structure
The puzzle input is stored in the `res` directory following the name schema `aoc_{day}.txt`.

The program code is stored in `src` directory following the name schema `aoc_{day}.rs`. The `main.rs` file obviously contains the main method.

## Build and execution
To build the project use `cargo build`.

To run the project use `cargo run`.
